This class wraps Swift's URL `bookmark` functionality. See [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/AccessingFilesandDirectories/AccessingFilesandDirectories.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH3-SW10) for further information.

A bookmark can be stored (eg. on disk, in a database etc.) and reloaded and it will be able to locate the original target for the bookmark, even it has been moved or renamed.

A bookmark is an opaque data structure, enclosed in a `Data` object, that describes the location of a file. Whereas path and file reference URLs are potentially fragile between launches of your app, a bookmark can usually be used to re-create a URL to a file even in cases where the file was moved or renamed.

## Usage

### Create and use a bookmark

```swift
// The original file url
let originalURL = URL(targetFileURL: ...)!

// Create a bookmark
let bookmark = try Bookmark(targetFileURL: originalURL)

// Extension on URL to generate a bookmark
let bookmark2 = try originalURL.bookmark()

// Access to the raw bookmark data
let bookmarkData = bookmark.bookmarkData

// Resolve the bookmark and retrieve its state and target url
let resolved = try bookmark.resolved()

try bookmark.resolving { resolvedItem in
   // Do something with the resolvedItem which is the original URL and its state
}

// ... Somewhere in here, the original url file is moved or renamed ...

try bookmark.resolving { resolvedItem in
   // Do something with the resolvedItem (which will correctly point to the new URL location)
}
```

### Save/Load bookmark data

`Bookmark` fully supports the `Codable` protocol.

```swift
// The original file url
let originalURL = URL(targetFileURL: ...)!

// Create a bookmark
let bookmark = try Bookmark(targetFileURL: originalURL)

// Grab out the raw bookmark data
let storableData = bookmark.bookmarkData

// ...Save the bookmark data for later use, eg. in CoreData or in a database...

// Load the bookmark data back out from the storage medium...
let savedBookmarkData = <load bookmark data from somewhere>
// ... and recreate the Bookmark object from the data
let existingBookmark = try Bookmark(bookmarkData: savedBookmarkData)

// Use the loaded bookmark
try existingBookmark.resolving { resolved in
   // ...Do something with the resolved bookmark URL
}
```
